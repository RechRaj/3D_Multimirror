# 3D Multimirror

---

The project is based on Multimirror reflection to demonstrate the working for the 3D image on a mirrored surface. 
Reflection in computer graphics is used to emulate reflective objects like mirrors and shiny surfaces and it is accomplished 
in a ray trace renderer by following a ray from the eye to the mirror and then calculating where it bounces from, and continuing the 
process until no surface is found, or a non-reflective surface is found. A polished reflection has been used which is undistributed reflection like a mirror or a chrome. 

Reflection on a shiny surface like wood or tile can add to the photorealistic effects of a 3D rendering. In this project we will have 3D object Rendering in which it will 
show movement of ball around a cone and the reflection of the image on the wall which can go up to infinite reflection images as we increase the number of mirror 
reflection on the wall and it will show top view of reflections in different mirrors which are implemented by using OpenGL in visual studio 2010.
